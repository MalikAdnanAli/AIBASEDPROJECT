# AIBASEDPROJECT
This project was submitted in codeutsava3.0 at NIT Raipur 2019. The main purpose of this project is to create a recommendation system for online shopping. We used unsupervised machine learning strategy (clustering) to cluster the items from the consumer's purchase history which shows same characterstics. When a consumer triggers a search, the model finds the most suitable cluster for searched item and shows all the items of that cluster to the consumer after some filtering under "things you may like" section. Also it shows results for the different types of searched item too (This is not a part of the recommendation system.
